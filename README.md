# IR_KEYPAD
Infrared Keyboard using Microchip microcontrollers and Infrared sensors.


### Introduction and purpose

While mechanical keyboards are the convetional and easy solution for the input of an user, since it is a mechanical device, it's life cycle is limited. Specially in an outdoors environment because the device can experience harsh temperature and humidity conditions.

That said, this keyboard doesn't doesn't feature any mechanical component, instead, it relies on infrared proximity sensors to detect the user's input. Furthermore, by not having any mechanical component, it's life cycle is inherently superior in comparison to the conventional mechanical keyboard.
